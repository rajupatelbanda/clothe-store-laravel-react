# Full Stack E-commerce Migration: Laravel to Node.js & Express

This document details the step-by-step implementation, packages installed, and functionalities covered during the conversion of the Laravel backend to a modern Node.js/Express stack, while maintaining full compatibility with the React.js frontend.

## 🛠️ Step 1: Backend Architecture (Node.js & Express)

### 📦 Packages Installed (Backend)
- `express`: Core web framework.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling for data schema.
- `dotenv`: Environment variable management.
- `cors`: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for frontend communication.
- `morgan`: HTTP request logger for development.
- `jsonwebtoken (JWT)`: Secure authentication tokens.
- `bcryptjs`: Password hashing and security.
- `multer`: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data (image uploads).
- `razorpay`: Payment gateway integration.
- `express-async-handler`: Simplified error handling for async routes.
- `slugify`: Generating URL-friendly strings for products/categories.
- `faker-js/faker`: Generating 200+ realistic dummy data items.

### ⚙️ Functionalities Implemented
1.  **Authentication System:**
    - JWT-based Login & Registration.
    - Password encryption using Bcrypt.
    - Middleware for `protect` (user) and `admin` only routes.
    - Role-based access control (Admin vs. User).
2.  **Product Management:**
    - CRUD operations for Products.
    - Complex filtering (Search, Multi-category, Multi-brand, Price Range).
    - Dynamic Variations (Color, Size, Price, Stock).
    - Image and Video URL handling.
    - "Featured" and "Trending" algorithms.
3.  **Order & Fulfillment:**
    - Cart to Checkout flow.
    - Order tracking and status management (Pending, Shipped, Delivered, etc.).
    - Laravel-parity response structure for Order History.
4.  **Admin Dashboard API:**
    - Statistics engine (Total Sales, Order counts, User counts).
    - Stock Management (Low stock alerts).
    - System Logs (Reading and deleting server-side log files).
5.  **Marketing & CMS:**
    - Dynamic Banners system with page-specific targeting.
    - Coupon application logic (Expiry checks, discount types).
    - Custom Page management (About Us, Terms, etc.).
6.  **Data Seeding:**
    - A robust `seed.js` script generating 200 products, 10 brands, 10 categories, and 5 banners automatically.

### 📚 Backend Topics Covered
- RESTful API Design.
- MongoDB Aggregation & Mongoose Virtuals (for reviews).
- Middleware implementation (Auth & Error Handling).
- File System (FS) integration for Log management.
- Payment Gateway Integration (Webhooks & Verification).

## 🎨 Step 2: Frontend Integration (React.js)

### 📦 Packages Verified/Utilized
- `axios`: API communication.
- `react-router-dom`: SPA routing and navigation.
- `swiper`: Interactive product carousels.
- `react-hook-form`: Optimized form handling.
- `react-hot-toast`: Real-time user notifications.

### ⚙️ Functionalities Implemented/Fixed
1.  **Seamless API Transition:**
    - Updated interceptors to handle JWT tokens instead of Sanctum.
    - Adjusted data mapping to bridge the gap between MongoDB `_id` and Frontend `id`.
2.  **Shop Page Optimization:**
    - Fixed "Blank Page" issues by aligning backend pagination with Laravel's `data` and `last_page` structure.
    - Implemented real-time search and filter updates.
3.  **Product Details Revamp:**
    - **Dynamic Variations:** Implemented logic where selecting a size/color updates the price and stock status instantly.
    - **Price Accuracy:** Fixed the "Real Price vs. Sale Price" bug to ensure strikethrough prices update with variations.
    - **Video Integration:** Added a functional video player for "Experience the Fabric" section.
4.  **Admin Redirection:**
    - Enhanced Login logic to automatically detect roles and route Admins to the Dashboard and Users to the Storefront.

### 📚 Frontend Topics Covered
- Context API for Global State (Auth, Cart, Wishlist).
- Conditional Rendering based on Auth state.
- Dynamic Route Parameters (Slugs).
- Complex Form validation and submission.
- Environment Variable Management (`.env`).

## 🚀 Step 3: End-to-End Deployment Ready
- **Database:** Fully migrated to MongoDB Atlas.
- **Port Consistency:** Backend locked to port 8000 to match Frontend `.env` configuration.
- **Git:** All changes pushed to the `client` branch for version control.
